- 👋 Hi, I’m Kura Adams
- 👀 When I get better at git I'll be back here to jooosh up my profile.
- 🌱 But for now I'd like to thank you for taking the time to look through my codes.
- 💞️ I’m afraid theyre gonna look as budget as my profile, and it'll take a while to produce but as soon as I do youll get to see them. Hope you find them interesting.
- 📫 And look forward to possibly collaborating with you in the future. If so here's how to reach me.
